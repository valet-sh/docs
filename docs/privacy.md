## RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR DATA PROCESSING ON THIS WEBSITE
TechDivision GmbH  
An der Alten Spinnerei 2 A  
83059 Kolbermoor

## PRIVACY PROTECTION
The use of this website is possible without providing any personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or email addresses) are collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, as far as possible.  These data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent. We point out that data transmission in the Internet (e.g. in case of communication via e-mail) may have security flaws. A complete protection of data against the access by third parties is not possible.

## SSL- AND/OR TLS ENCRYPTION
For safety reasons and in order to protect the transmission of confidential information you send to us as site operators, our website uses a SSL and/or TLS encryption. You may recognize the encrypted connection by the “https://“ URL and the lock icon in the address line.

## COOKIES
This website just uses a technically necessary session cookie (JSESSIONID), which will be deleted after your session. Furthermore we do not use any other cookies and will not track you.

## SERVER LOG FILES
The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files which your browser transmits automatically to us. These are:

* Browser type/ browser version
* Operating system used (User agent parameters of the browser)
* Referrer URL
* Requested URL
* Data size of the server response
* IP address of the accessing computer
* Time of the server request

These data cannot be attributed directly to certain persons. A combination of these data with other data sources is not done. We reserve the right to check these data subsequently if we become aware of specific indications for illegal usage.

## CONTACT
If you send us an inquiry via email or github, your data given in the inquiry including the contact data you stated there will be stored by us for processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions until the processing is finished.  As a matter of course these data will not be passed on to third parties.

## RIGHT TO DATA PORTABILITY
You retain the right that the data which we process in an automated way on the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract are surrendered to you or to third parties. They will be provided in a machine-readable form. In case you request the direct transmission of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done if technically feasible.

## INFORMATION, CORRECTION, BLOCKING AND DELETION OF DATA
You are at any time entitled to get free information on your personal data stored, their origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and you are entitled to correction, blocking or deletion of these data. For this purpose or in case of further questions you may at any time contact us at the address stated in the legal details or you contact directly our data security officer named below. We will gladly take care of your request.

## RIGHT OF OBJECTION AGAINST DATA COLLECTION IN SPECIAL CASES AS WELL AS AGAINST DIRECT MAIL (ART. 21 DSGVO)
In case of data processing on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation) you are at any time entitled to file an objection against the processing of your personal data for reasons resulting from your special situation; this also applies for profiling based on these regulations. If you file an objection your relevant personal data will no longer be processed, unless we can provide compelling legitimate reasons for the processing, outweighing your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves for the assertion, exertion or defence of legal claims (objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation)).

If your personal data are processed for direct mail, you have the right to file an objection at any time against the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is in conjunction with such direct mail (objection according to Art. 21 para. 2 DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation)).
