# Mailpit

!!! Quote
    "An email and SMTP testing tool with API for developers" - please visit *[https://github.com/axllent/mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit)* for more information.


## Usage

You can access the UI via *[https://mailpit.test](https://mailpit.test)*

PHP is configured to use mailpit automatically (e.g. the mail() function), but you can use SMTP with host <strong>localhost</strong> and port <strong>8025</strong> as well.
