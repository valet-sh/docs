# MailHog

!!! Quote
    "Mailhog is an email testing tool for developers" - please visit https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog for more information.


## Usage

You can access the UI via *[https://mailhog.test](https://mailhog.test)*

PHP is configured to use mailhog automatically (e.g. the mail() function), but you can use SMTP with host <strong>localhost</strong> and port <strong>8025</strong> as well.
